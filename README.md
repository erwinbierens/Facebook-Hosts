=================

This file is being used for blocking Facebook. 

Facebook-blocking hosts file additions. 

Please fork and add your own hosts if you know any other Facebook-controlled domains.

### Install hosts file
For Mac: Put the file in the Desktop, then Open a terminal, and do this command: " cp ~/Desktop/hosts /etc/  " And, it's done. pretty easy. If it's not working, try with "sudo" in front of the command. "sudo cp ~/Desktop/hosts /etc/ " That's finish and you can remove the file from your desktop if you want.

For Windows: Put the file "hosts" in the C:\ Disk (at the root). Push the windows button, type "Command" and right click the result. Select "execute/Open as Administrator" . Once there, just type  this: "copy \hosts \drivers\etc\" . That should do it. You can remove the file you put in C:\ now.
